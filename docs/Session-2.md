## **Session 2: React Basics: Meet Components and JSX!** ðŸ§©

### **1. Recap of Session 1**

Before we dive into new material, let's quickly recap what we learned in the last session:
- We set up our React development environment.
- We learned about the structure of a React project.
- We created and rendered our first React component.
- We got introduced to JSX, a special syntax that looks like HTML but works in JavaScript.

Now, let's take these concepts further!

### **2. Deep Dive into Components**

Components are the heart and soul of React. They are reusable pieces of code that represent parts of your website. Letâ€™s explore how to create different types of components and understand why they are so powerful.

#### **2.1 Functional Components**

The simplest way to create a component in React is by using a **functional component**. We briefly touched on this in the last session, but now let's look at it in more detail.

A functional component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX. Here's an example:

```javascript
function WelcomeMessage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome to Your React Journey!</h2>
      <p>This is a functional component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default WelcomeMessage;
```

When you use this component in your app, it will display a heading and a paragraph. The power of functional components lies in their simplicity and reusability.

#### **2.2 Class Components (Optional for Advanced Students)**

While functional components are most common in modern React, you might also encounter **class components**. A class component is another way to create components using ES6 class syntax.

Hereâ€™s what a simple class component looks like:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Hello from a Class Component!</h2>
        <p>This is a more advanced concept but still easy to grasp.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Greeting;
```

**Class components** were widely used in older versions of React, but today, functional components with hooks (which weâ€™ll cover in future sessions) are the standard. However, itâ€™s good to know both!

### **3. Understanding JSX in Detail**

JSX is a game-changer in React because it allows you to write what looks like HTML directly inside your JavaScript code. However, it's more than just HTML â€“ it's a powerful way to describe the UI of your React components.

#### **3.1 What Exactly is JSX?**

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. Itâ€™s a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. But remember, JSX is not HTML â€“ it's JavaScript under the hood.

Hereâ€™s an example of JSX:

```jsx
const greeting = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This is compiled into JavaScript code that looks like this:

```javascript
const greeting = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
```

So, JSX makes it easier and more intuitive to create React elements.

#### **3.2 Embedding JavaScript in JSX**

One of the coolest things about JSX is that you can embed JavaScript expressions directly in it using curly braces `{}`.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```jsx
const name = 'Alice';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

In this example, the value of the `name` variable is inserted directly into the JSX. When rendered, the output will be:

```html
<h1>Hello, Alice!</h1>
```

You can also embed any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces, like calling a function or performing calculations.

```jsx
const user = {
  firstName: 'Alice',
  lastName: 'Johnson'
};

function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const element = <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
```

This flexibility makes JSX a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive UIs.

### **4. Creating and Rendering Components with JSX**

Letâ€™s take what weâ€™ve learned about components and JSX and put it into practice by building a small React app.

#### **4.1 Building a Simple Component**

We'll start by creating a component called `UserCard`. This component will display a userâ€™s name, age, and a short description.

Hereâ€™s how you can create the `UserCard` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function UserCard() {
  const name = 'John Doe';
  const age = 25;
  const description = 'A passionate React learner.';

  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserCard;
```

This component uses JSX to return a block of HTML-like code that includes JavaScript variables.

#### **4.2 Rendering the Component**

To see our `UserCard` component in action, we need to render it in the main `App.js` file.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import UserCard from './UserCard';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Meet Our User</h1>
      <UserCard />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

When you run your React app (`npm start`), you should see the `UserCard` displayed with the userâ€™s name, age, and description.

### **5. Nesting Components**

One of the most powerful features of React is the ability to **nest components**. This means you can create a component and use it inside another component, like building with LEGO blocks.

Letâ€™s create another component called `HobbyList` and nest it inside `UserCard`.

#### **5.1 Creating the `HobbyList` Component**

Hereâ€™s the `HobbyList` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function HobbyList() {
  const hobbies = ['Reading', 'Coding', 'Hiking'];

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
      <ul>
        {hobbies.map(hobby => (
          <li key={hobby}>{hobby}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HobbyList;
```

This component creates a list of hobbies using the `map` function to loop through the `hobbies` array.

#### **5.2 Nesting `HobbyList` in `UserCard`**

Now, letâ€™s nest `HobbyList` inside `UserCard`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import HobbyList from './HobbyList';

function UserCard() {
  const name = 'John Doe';
  const age = 25;
  const description = 'A passionate React learner.';

  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <HobbyList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserCard;
```

With this change, when you run your app, the userâ€™s hobbies will now be displayed as part of the `UserCard` component.

### **6. Interactive Exercise: Customize Your Components**

Now it's your turn! Hereâ€™s a fun exercise to practice what you've learned:

1. **Create a new component** called `ProfilePicture.js` that displays a userâ€™s profile picture.
2. **Nest this component** inside the `UserCard` component, just like we did with `HobbyList`.
3. **Update the `UserCard` component** to pass the picture URL as a prop to `ProfilePicture`.

Hereâ€™s a hint to get you started with `ProfilePicture`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function ProfilePicture(props) {
  return <img src={props.url} alt="User Profile" />;
}

export default ProfilePicture;
```

Donâ€™t forget to import and use the `ProfilePicture` component inside `UserCard`!
