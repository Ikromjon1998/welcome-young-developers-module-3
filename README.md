  React is like a magic tool that lets us build modern and super cool websites. It makes our websites interactive, which means they can change and respond to what people do!

  Weâ€™ll create a simple project where components pass props around like a relay race. Watch how information travels!

  When the state changes, the website can change too! Thatâ€™s how we make our sites dynamic and fun to use.
